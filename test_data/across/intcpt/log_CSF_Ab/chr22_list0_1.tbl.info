# This file contains a short description of the columns in the
# meta-analysis summary file, named 'across/intcpt/log_CSF_Ab/chr22_list0_1.tbl'

# Marker      - this is the marker name
# Allele1     - the first allele for this marker in the first file where it occurs
# Allele2     - the second allele for this marker in the first file where it occurs
# Freq1       - weighted average of frequency for allele 1 across all studies
# FreqSE      - corresponding standard error for allele frequency estimate
# MinFreq     - minimum frequency for allele 1 across all studies
# MaxFreq     - maximum frequency for allele 1 across all studies
# Effect      - overall estimated effect size for allele1
# StdErr      - overall standard error for effect size estimate
# P-value     - meta-analysis p-value
# Direction   - summary of effect direction for each study, with one '+' or '-' per study
# HetISq      - I^2 statistic which measures heterogeneity on scale of 0-100%
# HetChiSq    - chi-squared statistic in simple test of heterogeneity
# df          - degrees of freedom for heterogeneity statistic
# HetPVal     - P-value for heterogeneity statistic
# Ntotal    - custom variable 1
